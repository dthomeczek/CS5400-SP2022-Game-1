# CS5400 Game 1

This was the first chess AI assignment for CS5400. In this assignment we were to develop the movement functionality and a random movement AI to play a game of chess. The framework was developed by SIG-Game at Missouri S&T. Edited files consist of [movement.py](https://github.com/dthomeczek/CS5400-SP2022-Game-1/blob/main/Joueur.py/games/chess/movement.py) which contains the movement functionality for each piece and [ai.py](https://github.com/dthomeczek/CS5400-SP2022-Game-1/blob/main/Joueur.py/games/chess/ai.py).
